![Dashboard Preview]
## 🎯 Overview

This project presents an interactive geographic analysis system that visualizes critical global development indicators across three comprehensive dashboards. The system processes and presents data from 195+ countries, enabling users to explore relationships between population demographics, education systems, and economic performance.

**Project Goals:**
- Transform complex global datasets into actionable insights
- Identify correlations between education investment and economic indicators
- Visualize demographic trends and population projections
- Provide interactive exploration of geographic data patterns

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts, maps, and graphs with filtering capabilities
- **Multi-Dashboard Architecture**: Three specialized dashboards for focused analysis
- **Geographic Heat Maps**: Visual representation of country-level metrics
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side country and regional comparisons
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical data and future projections
- **Data Quality**: Cleaned and validated dataset with null value handling

## 📊 Dashboards

### 1. Global Population & Demographics
- **Total Population**: 8 billion tracked globally
- **Average Life Expectancy**: 74.24 years
- **Visualizations**:
  - Population distribution by country
  - Population projections through 2050
  - Life expectancy vs median age correlation
  - Interactive world map with population density

### 2. Education & Literacy
- **Average Global Literacy Rate**: 87.38%
- **Average GDP Allocation**: 4.36%
- **Visualizations**:
  - Literacy rate heat map by country
  - Education investment by country (top 10)
  - Gender-based literacy comparison
  - Regional literacy disparities

### 3. Employment & Economy
- **Average Unemployment Rate**: 6.93%
- **Visualizations**:
  - GDP per capita by country
  - Unemployment rate distribution
  - Inflation trends across countries
  - Economic indicator correlations
  - Net worth distribution map

## 📁 Data Source

**Primary Source**: [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/)

**Data Collection Period**: [17/10/2025]

**Coverage**: 195+ countries across 6 continents

**Metrics Collected**:
- Population statistics and projections
- Literacy rates (male/female)
- Education investment (% of GDP)
- GDP per capita
- Unemployment rates
- Inflation rates
- Life expectancy
- Median age

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The raw dataset required significant preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency for visualization.

### Cleaning Steps Performed:

**1. Null Value Handling**
- Identified missing values across all metrics
- Applied country-specific imputation for partial data
- Removed records with >50% missing critical fields
- Documented all data gaps for transparency

**2. Data Standardization**
- Normalized country names (e.g., "USA" → "United States")
- Standardized GDP values to consistent currency (USD)
- Converted all percentages to decimal format
- Aligned date formats across datasets

**3. Outlier Detection**
- Identified and validated statistical outliers
- Cross-referenced suspicious values with secondary sources
- Flagged but retained legitimate extreme values (e.g., Monaco GDP per capita)

**4. Data Validation**
- Verified literacy rates within 0-100% range
- Checked population figures against official census data
- Validated GDP calculations and conversions
- Ensured consistency across related metrics

**5. Data Transformation**
- Created calculated fields (e.g., total population from demographics)
- Aggregated data at continent and regional levels
- Generated year-over-year change calculations
- Structured data for optimal dashboard performance

### Tools Used:
- Power query for data cleaning
- Power BI for manual validation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Visualization Tool**: [Power BI] <!-- Add your actual tool -->
- **Data Cleaning**: Power query
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Data Format**: CSV


## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Education-Economy Correlation**: Countries with higher education investment (>6% of GDP) show 23% higher average GDP per capita

2. **Literacy Gaps**: Despite 87.38% global average, regional disparities exceed 50 percentage points between highest and lowest performing regions

3. **Demographic Shifts**: Population projections indicate significant workforce changes, with some regions facing aging populations while others experience youth bulges

4. **Economic Indicators**: Strong inverse correlation between literacy rates and unemployment across analyzed countries

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement predictive modeling for future trends
- [ ] Include additional metrics (healthcare, infrastructure)
- [ ] Add drill-down functionality for city-level data
- [ ] Implement real-time data updates via API
- [ ] Add export functionality for custom reports
- [ ] Include narrative insights and recommendations
